# Pet Feeder Project

## Description
---
The project implements an automatic pet feeder where the user can schedule how often his pet receives food. 
Initially it displays a welcome message then the current hour(it starts at 0:00:00, but the user can change it) and the remaining time (RT) untill the fall. This values can be changed by pressing the button and entering a password. The correct password is formed of 4 digits (0000).
In the setting menu, the user can do the following:
- Change the current time (selecting the "Set the time" option). As default, the time starts at 0:00:00.
- Set an hour from which to start the falling of food in equal intervals (selecting the "Ch. hour" option). In this case the RT remains locked until that time. The default values are 00:00:00.
- Change the interval of the falls (selecting the "Ch. Int" option). The default value is 30 seconds.

## Used tutorial
---
The inspiration for this project came from this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjiexlL6Cfo) where the user can set the exact hour for the fall of food. In my project, the user can set the current hour, a starting hour for the food to start falling and an interval of time between the falls.
